# Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Projects

Welcome to the **Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Projects** repository! This repo contains a series of deep learning projects where artificial neural networks (ANNs) are applied to solve various problems across different domains.

## Overview

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate the application of artificial neural networks in real-world scenarios. The projects cover topics such as data preprocessing, network architecture design, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation. Each project focuses on a specific problem and showcases how ANNs can be used to find solutions.

```

## Projects Included

1. **Project 1: Image Classification with ANN**
   - **Objective**: Classifying images into different categories using a neural network.
   - **Dataset**: [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html), containing 60,000 images in 10 classes.
   - **Network Architecture**: A simple feed-forward neural network with fully connected layers.
   - **Key Insights**: Achieved 80% accuracy using early stopping and dropout techniques.

2. **Project 2: Predicting House Prices with ANN**
   - **Objective**: Predicting house prices using various features like area, number of bedrooms, and location.
   - **Dataset**: [California Housing Dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/real_world.html#california-housing-dataset).
   - **Network Architecture**: A fully connected neural network with two hidden layers and ReLU activation.
   - **Key Insights**: Improved performance by tuning the learning rate and using mean squared error as a loss function.

3. **Project 3: Sentiment Analysis with ANN**
   - **Objective**: Predicting the sentiment of movie reviews (positive or negative).
   - **Dataset**: [IMDB Movie Reviews](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/).
   - **Network Architecture**: A neural network for text classification using embedding layers and dense layers.
   - **Key Insights**: Achieved 90% accuracy by using word embeddings and optimizing the network's depth.

   git clone https://github.com/SyedSubhan12/ANN-Projects.git
   cd ANN-Projects
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Navigate to the project folder you want to explore:
   ```bash
   cd project_name
   ```

4. Run the data preprocessing script:
   ```bash
   python src/data_preprocessing.py
   ```

5. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python src/train_model.py
   ```

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Results

The performance of each neural network is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and loss. Detailed results are available in the `results/` directory of each project. For example:

- **Project 1**: Achieved 80% classification accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- **Project 2**: Reduced mean squared error to **X%** for house price prediction.
- **Project 3**: Achieved 90% accuracy in sentiment analysis.
